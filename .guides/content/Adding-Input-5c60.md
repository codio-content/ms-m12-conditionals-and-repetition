## Interact with your program

In the previous programs the variable `age` was set prior to the if statement. You manipulated the output by changing the assignment statement. In a real world program you would ask someone their age and then output the result.  

Taking in information is easy in Python. 

`name = input('What is your name?')`

- You will use the command input
- The prompt for information will be in parenthesis
 
`age = int(input('What is your age?'))`

- Input is defaulted to string data if you want to take in a number you have to specifically convert it to an int
