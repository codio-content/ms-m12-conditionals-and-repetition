## Python `while` compared to story
Lets look at the `while` example from the story.  The program on the left shows a while loop that prints horseshoe not flat. 

#### Simple `while` Loop

- WHILE the horseshoe is not flat
	- hit it with the hammer                    



## Python `while`  Syntax
Notice the syntax you must use when writing a `while`.

- The variable used in the condition must have a value to start (i = 0) 
- At the end of the condition being checked there is a colon : 
- the action after the condition is indented (visual clue)
- the variable used in the condition is changed
- after the loop it prints out that the horseshoe is now flat (this is not part of the loop)
