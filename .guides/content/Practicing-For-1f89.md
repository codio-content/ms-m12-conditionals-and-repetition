## Python `for` compared to story
Lets look at the for example from the story.  The program on the left shows a for loop that prints out "pump bellows". 

#### Simple `for` Loop

- FOR each number that you count from 1 to 10
	- give the bellows a pump.               


## Python `for` Syntax
Notice the syntax you must use when writing a `for`.

- The range function is commonly used to give the "range" of numbers.  1 is start, 10 end 
- At the end of the range/condition being checked there is a colon : 
- the action after the condition is indented (visual clue)
  
With the range function you can also include how the variable is to change. In the above example it automatically increased by 1.  You can however have it increase by a different value.

- `for i in range(1,10,2):    //this will increase by 2`
