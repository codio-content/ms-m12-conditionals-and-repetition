# Loops
Loops are how a repetitive action is handled.  If many grades are to be added in order to average them, a loop can handle adding all of the grades. Any type of repeated action can be translated into a loop.  We will look at the most common types of loops: `for` and `while`.

## `for` Loop
A `for` loop allows you to initiate a counter variable, a check condition, and a way to increment your counter all in one line. You know from the start how many times this loop will continue

## `while` Loop
A `while` loop will always evaluate a condition first to determine if the loop is to continue.  The condition will be changed at some point in the loop so that the while loop terminates. The number of times is not necessarily known.
