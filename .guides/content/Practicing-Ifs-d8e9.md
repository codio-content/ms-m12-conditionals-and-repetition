## Python `If` statements compared to story
Lets look at the first 2 examples from the story.  The program on the left shows similar if statements concerning whether or not someone can get a drivers license. 

#### Simple one condition `If` statement

- IF he is hungry                  
- eat                          

#### Simple two condition `If` statement

- IF the fountain is on
- play in the fountain
- ELSE
- swim around the large rock

## Python `If` statement Syntax
Notice the syntax you must use when writing an if statement.  

- At the end of the statement there is a colon : 
- the action after the condition is indented (visual clue)
- else is used for when the condition of the if is not true
 
Why is there 2 equal signs? Because there is a difference between assigning a value or checking to see if something is equal. 

- `x = 5`  is an assignment statement.  x is being assigned the value of 5 so x equals 5.  
- `if x == 5` is a conditional statement checking to see if the value of x is equal to 5.
