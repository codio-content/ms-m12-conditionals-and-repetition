Again there is a fairy tale that illustrates the concept of looping just as the one you read earlier for if statements.

## This story illustrates several loops

### `while` Loop with condition

- WHILE the horseshoe is not flat, hit it with the hammer.


### `for` Loop

- FOR each number that you count from 1 to 10, give the bellows a pump.


### Nested Loop  (can be any combination of `while` & `for`)

- WHILE the sword is not thin enough: 
- Turn it over 
- FOR each number from 1 to 5, hit it with the hammer.
